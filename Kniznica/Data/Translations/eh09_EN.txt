Anita: Hi (guys)! I am Anita| and (you) watch the Easy Hungarian.| Today’s our question however (is) that,| what makes you more happy?|
A: I would like to ask you| that what makes you more happy?|
F1: Jokingly or seriously?|
A: Both (two), but rather jokingly.|
F1: Jokingly I can’t answer,| because I have 2 children,| and since they are,| (from that time) that makes me happier| when I am with them.|  
That even more happy makes (me)| when (there) is in my hand| a rose wine and soda water mix |
and when this all comes together| then that is miraculously good.|
Generally| only in one point of time a year| (this) somes together| when the summer (is).| 
Thats why I love| especially the summer| because then (it) is so| that we are out,| on free (air) we are| together (there) is a ot of children,| there are their parents.| They are running around| we drink| good chilled  rose wine and soda water mix| around the fire| and to this (there is) nothing better on the world.|
A: To this really| nothing can be better.| Thank you nicely!|
