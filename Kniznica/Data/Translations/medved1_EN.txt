LUKA:It isn't right, madam....| You're destroying yourself.|| The maid and the lady cook have gone off strawberry picking,| every living being is rejoicing,||| even the cat| she  understands her joy|| and walks about in the yard,| birdies catching;||| and you sit in the room all day,| as if in a monastery,|| and no joy.||| Yes, really!| Consider: the whole year has gone| that you do not leave the house!|||

POPOVA: And I shall never go out...| Why? My life is already at an end.|| He lies in the grave,| and I have buried myself| between four walls..|| We have both died.|||

LUKA: Well,| Would not hear this!|| Well, Nicolai Mihailovitch had died,| well, it should be so| the will of God,| heavenly kingdom to him...
